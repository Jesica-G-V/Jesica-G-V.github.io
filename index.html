									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>My name is Jesica G V. I'm an Btech student at RajaRajeswari College of Engineering, Computer Science Department. I was born and raised in Bangalore.
										During my Engineering, I have worked on several projects.To get a real world work experience, I did two Internships as a Azure Cloud Engineer. The first Internship was at Sonata Information Technologies Limited for a period of two months. The second one was at Krish Software Services for a period of one month. I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.</p>
